# Assumptions & Decisions During Development

#### 1. App is created via create-react-app in windows machine. You may need to adjust forward slash("/") & back slash("\\") in macOs if unable to start.

#### 2. Theme config is stored in react context. Theme can be changed by clicking cta button in header section of the page.

#### 3. Global state (theme-context) of the app can be found under src/store folder.

#### 4. I have use Css Module for locally scope css rules as css module helps in generating unique class names during compilation. it helps to avoid name clashes.

#### 5. I have used various sass feature like partials, inheritance, variables, nested rules etc for stying & reusing css rules.

#### 6. Larger Components are broken down to smaller UI components to achieve code modularity.

#### 7. I have tried to minimize use of inline styles but in few cases to utilize flexibility of a component I have used dynamic inline styling.

#### 8. Folder structure are can be standardized based on organizational standardization. I have use this structure as choice of personal preference on organizing my files.

#### 9. I have used storybook controls instead of knobs as knobs are deprecated in newer versions of storybook. controls are newer way of doing the same task. Found from github issue -- https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/discussions/15060

#### 10. I have developed some additional UI components like buttons, card, backdrop to reuse those UI in both the brands.

#### 11. Button are configurable via props. i.e Button can accept backgroundColor, borderColor, textColor, onClick etc. as props to make button more Generic & Reusable.

#### 12. Card component can accept backgroundColor, textColor as props.

#### 13. Both Brand A and Brand B Component reuses Card & Button component with its own configurations.
