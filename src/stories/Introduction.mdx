# Assumptions During Development

#### 1. App is created via create-react-app in windows machine. You may need to adjust forward slash(/) & back slash(\) in macOs if unable to start.

#### 2. Theme config is stored in react context. Theme can be changed by clicking cta button in header section of the page.

#### 3. I have use Css Module for locally scope css rules as css module helps in generating unique class names during compilation. it helps to avoid name clashes.

#### 4. I have used storybook controls instead of knobs as knobs are depecrated in newer versions of storybook. controls are newer way of doing the same task. Found from github issue -- https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/discussions/15060

#### 5. I have developed some additional UI components like buttons, card, backdrop to reuse those UI in both the brands.
